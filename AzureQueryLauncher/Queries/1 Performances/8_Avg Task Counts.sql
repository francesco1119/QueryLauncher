------

-- Sustained values above 10 suggest further investigation in that area (depending on your Service Tier)
-- Avg Task Counts will be higher with lower service tiers
-- High Avg Task Counts are often caused by blocking/deadlocking or other resource contention

-- Sustained values above 1 suggest further investigation in that area
-- High Avg Runnable Task Counts are a good sign of CPU pressure
-- High Avg Pending DiskIO Counts are a sign of disk pressure
