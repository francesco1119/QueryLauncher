	-- Helps determine which database files on the entire instance have the most I/O bottlenecks
	-- This can help you decide whether certain LUNs are overloaded and whether you might
	-- want to move some files to a different location or perhaps improve your I/O performance
	-- These latency numbers include all file activity against each database file since SQL Server was last started
